    <h2>My Journey Through Bangkit 2024 and the Skills Forging My Tech Career</h2>
    <p><em>2024-12-13 · tags: experience, learning</em></p>

    <p>My nearly four-month journey in Bangkit has finally come to an end. It all started when I was 19 years old and saw my senior join the program. At first, I had no idea what Bangkit was, but after researching, it instantly caught my attention.</p>

    <p>Bangkit is a program initiated by major companies like Google, Tokopedia, and Gojek, together with Indonesia’s Ministry of Education, to provide high-quality training in specific areas. It’s one of the most rigorous and transformative tech bootcamps in the country, designed to bridge the gap between academic learning and industry needs.</p>

    <p>At the time of writing, Bangkit offers three learning paths:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Cloud Computing (my choice)</li>
      <li>Mobile Development</li>
      <li>Machine Learning</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each path has its own curriculum and resources:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Cloud Computing uses materials from Google Cloud Skill Boost (GCSB) and Dicoding.</li>
      <li>Machine Learning combines Dicoding and Coursera materials.</li>
      <li>Mobile Development focuses on Dicoding modules.</li>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The program relies heavily on self-learning, which might seem daunting at first but is manageable with resilience and good time management.</p>

    <h2>The Learning Experience</h2>

    <p>The program is no walk in the park. Between the never-ending assignments, attending meetings, Instructor-Led Training (ILT) sessions, and college exams, life felt like a juggling act on steroids. Coffee wasn’t just a beverage; it was my survival tool.</p>

    <p>There were nights when I worked on assignments until 2 AM, knowing I had a college exam at 8 AM the next morning. There were days when I attended Bangkit group meetings during class, muting my mic so my lecturer wouldn’t notice. Sometimes, I’d review material during lunch, then prepare for a presentation right after.</p>
    
    <p>One particularly chaotic week stands out: I had a midterm exam, a critical Bangkit project deadline, and a meeting with our mentor—all in the same week. I survived thanks to the Pomodoro technique (25 minutes of focus, 5 minutes of rest… though sometimes I stretched that rest scrolling TikTok).</p>

    <p>Was I flawless in managing Bangkit and college? Absolutely not. But the goal was never perfection—it was persistence.</p>

    <h2>The Capstone Project</h2>

    <p>The capstone project marks the culmination of the Bangkit journey. Teams from different learning paths collaborate to create a real-world product. My team comprised:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>2 Cloud Computing participants</li>
      <li>3 Machine Learning participants</li>
      <li>2 Mobile Development participants</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We brainstormed and built Hyfit, a calorie-tracking app with food-scanning capabilities. The original idea included more features like workout management and meal planning, but due to the tight one-month deadline, we focused on:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Authentication</li>
      <li>Profile management</li>
      <li>Food scanner functionality</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As a Cloud Computing participant, I handled the backend and cloud deployment using:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>NestJS (chosen over Go for team familiarity)</li>
      <li>Cloud Run for deployment</li>
      <li>Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) for the database</li>
      <li>Cloud Storage for model deployment</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We faced challenges like running out of cloud credits due to configuration issues, but Bangkit provided extra credits upon request.</p>

    <p>The Machine Learning team built the image recognition model, while the Mobile team developed the frontend and integrated it with our APIs.</p>

    <p>We presented our project twice — a recorded demo and a live peer review. Despite nerves, our preparation paid off, and we successfully delivered our presentation.</p>

    <h2>Mentorship and Support</h2>

    <p>Each group in Bangkit is assigned a mentor, usually an alumnus who understands the struggles firsthand. My mentor specialized in Cloud Computing and was always ready to help. Their mantra:</p>

    <pre>“Mentor itu harus kalian ‘ganggu’ terus” — Don’t hesitate to reach out to your mentor frequently.</pre>

    <p>I often messaged my mentor late at night with questions, and their patience reminded me that I wasn’t alone.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>

    <p>When asked to sum up my Bangkit experience in one word, my answer is simple: resilience — the ability to persevere and adapt when everything seems to pile up all at once.</p>

    <p>Bangkit taught me more than technical skills. It taught me adaptability, teamwork, and the value of asking for help. Resilience isn’t about being perfect; it’s about showing up, trying your best, and finding creative ways to keep moving forward — even if that means sneaking in work during lectures or staying up past midnight debugging code.</p>

    <p>Bangkit is tough, but it’s also transformative. It’s more than a bootcamp — it’s a journey of self-discovery, growth, and (lots of) caffeine-fueled late nights.</p>

    <p>To anyone considering joining Bangkit: take it one day at a time, don’t hesitate to seek help, and celebrate your progress — no matter how small. You’re doing better than you think, and every step forward is worth it.</p>

    <p>I’m immensely grateful to my teammates — Renza, Adit, Alvien, Radit, Annaz, and Huda — for their dedication and collaboration. This journey has been unforgettable.</p>

    <p>Thank you for reading on my Bangkit journey. Peace out!</p>
